# Pizza_place_sales_Analysis

## Overview
This project explores an in-depth analysis of a year's sales data from a fictitious pizza restaurant to understand business performance, including order trends, top-selling pizzas, customer preferences, and time-based patterns (daily, weekly, monthly).

## üìÅ Dataset
This dataset contains 4 datasets:
- order_details.csv - Captures the ordered quantity and corresponding pizza for every order record. 
- orders.csv - Records the exact timestamp for every order transaction.
- pizza_types.csv - Includes detailed information on pizza categories and corresponding names.
- pizzas.csv - contains the size and price associated with each pizza.

## üéØ Objectives
- Identify the best and worst-selling pizza types
- Determine peak order times (hours/days/months)
- Understand how pizza size affects sales
- Discover seasonal trends
- Recommend actions to improve profitability

## Key Questions Explored
- What is the Total revenue and Quantity sold?
- What is the Revenue contribution(%) by pizza size and Category?
- Which hours have peak sales?
- How many sales are made on each day of the week?
- What are the top 5 best-selling pizzas?
- What trends exist in customer ordering behaviour?
- What are the monthly sales trends?

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Insights
- Sales peaked in July, indicating elevated customer demand outside traditional holiday periods.
- Sales peak around noon (12th hour), suggesting the highest customer activity at that time, while a sharp decline occurs after 6:00 PM. 
- The Large pizza size generates the highest revenue, while XL and XXL contribute less, potentially due to higher cost, limited marketing, and availability.
- The Classic category contributes the highest revenue, with all categories maintaining a fairly balanced share between 24% and 27%, indicating diverse customer preferences. While a balanced distribution is ideal, significant dominance by a single category could risk losses in others. 
- The Classic Deluxe Pizza leads in quantity sold, making it the most popular choice, while the Thai Chicken Pizza generates the highest revenue, reflecting a greater profit margin per unit.
- The Classic Deluxe Pizza is the best-selling item by quantity, whereas the Thai Chicken Pizza generates the highest revenue, indicating higher profitability per unit.

## Recommendations
- Leverage the month sales peaked by implementing limited-time promotions or flash discounts to enhance sales performance.
- Target marketing efforts or special promotions during peak hours to maximize engagement and consider strategies to boost evening sales.
- Run targeted marketing campaigns and gather customer feedback to better understand and improve the popularity of larger sizes.
- Conduct market research to better understand customer preferences and address underperforming categories, or focus on the strongest category to optimize profitability.
